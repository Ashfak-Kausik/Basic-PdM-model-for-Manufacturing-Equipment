PdM mean Predictive Maintenance. It is is used in manufacturing to prevent unexpected equipment failures by predicting when maintenance should be performed. This project aims to predict equipment failure based on historical sensor data.

Objectives:
1. Analyze historical sensor data to predict when a machine is likely to fail.
2. Develop a model to classify equipment status as healthy, needs maintenance, or likely to fail.
3. Demonstrate the application of AI techniques to real-world engineering problems.
4. Design and Approach:

Steps:
Step 1: Data Collection: Use historical sensor data, including temperature, vibration, pressure, and other key metrics.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and standardize or normalize features.
Step 3: Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features that capture critical patterns in the data.
Step 4: Model Building: Train classification models to predict equipment status.
Step 5: Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Step 6: Visualization: Visualize results to show predictions and trends in equipment performance.
